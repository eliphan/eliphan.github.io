First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Elise Phan, an aspiring artist who is still trying to support herself after college. I got my Bachelor degree in Illustration, a "useless degree" according to most of my friends and family. And I have to, sadly, agree with that. After just a few months after graduating from college, I found myself working in a full-time customer service job just to make ends meet. I told myself that this is just temporary and I can always find art jobs on the side. 
Fast forward two years later, I'm still working for barely above minimum wage at that very same place. Nothing changed, except that I can barely draw anymore due to fatigue, stress, and lack of imagination. Who would've thought that working in retail and customer service could be this tiresome? After a series of unfortunate events at work and at home, I finally decided to quit my job and start to look for another career. I want to go back to school to learn something else. Something more "practical" and more "desirable."

There are so many choices out there, so why coding? 

It's not easy to change career. There was so many factors to consider, including tuition, housing, and most importantly, time. Time is the crucial aspect here. I can't spend another 2-3 years for a certificate or a degree, and most of the "fast" ones are either having too long of a waiting list, or ones that I don't care for. Also, I want to find a career that can utilize my skills in illustration and graphic design. And that was when I found coding, or better say, bootcamp.

I've actually had experience with programming when I was still in high school. I can vaguely remember that we need to use notepad to create a very simple website. I didn't know how and why it works at that time, but it was very cool and exciting to see your webpage load for the first time. Coding left such a pleasant impression on me that when I got into college, I chose Web Design as one of my elective courses. But I never think that I want to become a web developer or a programmer. 

Back to my research for a career change. In this date and age, when in doubt, people would always turn to the internet for advice. Something as important as changing career should've been asked for more than a thousand times already on Reddit. If you're not familiar with Reddit, it's an online forum in which you can post and ask literally everything.
The users' replies are most of the time very helpful and accurate. So I found this post about which certificate should one get for a good paying job in a short amount of time. Exactly what I need. Someone there mentioned bootcamps as a high risk, high reward choice. 

(Reddit is actually much more than what I just described so be sure to check it out for a nice surprise)

I got very interested in this "bootcamp" thing so I started to research more on that topic. I love working with computer so this should be a very good option.
It took me a few months to gather information on what exactly is web development, how to become one, which website offer free courses, which bootcamp to apply for, and how viable is this option. I took some free courses from Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, and prep courses from bootcamps to check if I can learn to code by myself. 
It turns out that while I'm positive that I like coding enough to consider it my new career, doing it by myself isn't easy. I eventually gather my courage (and money) to apply for a bootcamp.

And that was how I get into web development.
